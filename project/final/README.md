## Selecting a Topic

I'm deciding to recreate my own version of a site similar to IMDB. I wanted to create this because I enjoy watching movies and thought it would be fun to create a nice layout not only as a landing page for the site but also to incorporate some fun into coming up with silly names and content for movies that are based on real movies. I also thought that this site would be a good choice, because there can be a lot of content added, especially on something like the movie pages themselves, for example they can have a description, images from the movie, the case, reviews/ratings and more! I have to keep in mind though that because it is HTML/CSS there will be a lot of duplicate content as I won't be able to utilize something like components from a framework like React to try and minimize the amount of redudancy. This is leading me to think that there might be a search bar that doesn't work for the nav, but on the home page I could create a couple "trending movies" and use a small selection to go more indepth with them.

## Outline

To ChatGPT: `hello i want to create a spoof site of imdb for movies to list out different genres, show ratings, and reviews. Could you help me create a name and a basic description for the site? It can be a plan on words.`

ChatGPT: `ScreenScream: "From screams of laughter to screams of horror—where movie fans rate, review, and rave in the quirkiest way possible."`

I do like this idea for a name and description as horror is one of my favorite movie genres and to cut down on simplicity it might be better to stick with one genre of movies. I'll use this name to move forward and start building out an outline of a menu.

## Menu

1. **Home** - Overview of the latest horror reviews, trending horror movies, and featured genres.
2. **Genres** - Subcategories like Slasher, Supernatural, Psychological, Found Footage, Monster, and Horror-Comedy.
3. **Top Screams** - Lists of top-rated horror movies, scariest scenes, and fan-favorite scream queens/kings.
4. **Easter Eggs & Tropes** - A fun page highlighting common horror tropes, hidden references, and “did you catch that?” moments.
5. **About** - Information about "ScreenScream" and how users can participate in reviewing or suggesting content.
6. **Contact Us** - A simple form for feedback or submissions.
