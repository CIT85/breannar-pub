      <h2>Why I'm taking HTML/CSS</h2>
      <p>The main reason I'm taking HTML/CSS is to get my associates in web development to pursue a career as a
        full-stack developer! Before taking this course I taught myself html, css, javascript which then lead me to
        take on newer frameworks like React, Vue, NextJS and a couple others! </p>
      <p> I wanted to make sure that I not only
        expand upon my preexisting knowledge but also work on some bad habits with using way more divs than I should
        and start utilizing semantics more to make my websites more accessible! I also wanted to create more
        connections with others and get my name out there more to adapt and take on new challanges. Even though its
        week 3 of the course I'm still learning new knowledge that can help me when creating new sites in the future!

      <h2>What I think of ChatGPT for researching my selected topic</h2>
      <p>I think ChatGPT and other LLMs out there are great tools to help bounce ideas off of, especially for projects
        when you're pressed for time! For me, it helped give me some ideas of what topic I should chose, and knowing
        the different tags I needed to show off in my index page led me to settle on a Gaming New's site called
        Checkpoint Nexus! It can be hard for me to even come up with names I'm happy with using for projects so to
        allow ChatGPT to help generate some options and be able to pivot on the information and create something
        really helps my creative process.</p>
      <p>Personally I do struggle with the design aspects of sites too. So having a LLM that can help me layout a
        design and then changing the data based on what I need to include in the page really helps me create projects
        faster. If not for ChatGPT this creation process would take a lot longer on my end! Overall, I think they are
        useful tools to not only help create content but also just bounce ideas of off especially when I feel like I'm
        running into a wall with creative content.</p>

          inspiration for the site!
